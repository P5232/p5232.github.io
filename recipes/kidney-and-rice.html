            <p></p>
            <b>Bean Cooking Steps:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the beans in about 5 cups of water in a large pot at a slow boil.</li>
                <li>Dice the onions and garlic and split them equally into two containers. Add a bay leaf to each container.</li>
                <li>Dice the celery and carrots (quarter them before dicing) and place them in their own container. Save the celery butt, carrot butts, and celery leafy stalks to flavor the beans.</li>
                <li>In a large Dutch Oven, melt the butter and place the entire green jalapeno to sautee.</li>
                <li>Add one of the containers of diced onion, garlic, and a bay leaf.</li>
                <li>Add 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste to the pot and stir it around.</li>
                <li>With a mortar and pestle, grind the cumin and coriander seeds and add them to the pot and stir.</li>
                <li>Add the celery base, carrot bases, and celery stalks with leaves for flavor; all to be removed later. Simmer the bean flavoring and add water as needed to allow the flavors to be pulled out.</li>
                <li>After the kidney beans have become nearly finished (maybe 30-45 minutes), drain most excess water and add the beans to the Dutch Oven with the seasons. </li>
                <li>Simmer another approximately 20 minutes keeping an eye on the water level. Remove the celery, bay leaves, carrots and jalapeno that were added for flavor.</li>
                <li>Slide the jalapeno and add back into the beans (include seeds for a spicier dish; remove seeds for less spice).</li>
                <li>Taste and add salt and pepper as required.</li>
                <li>Stir in the cooked tofu and remove from the heat</li>

            </ol>
            <b>Rice Cooking Steps:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>While the beans are simmering, in a large pot, heat the vegetable oil on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the diced carrots and celery.</li>
                <li>Add the onions, garlic, and bay leaf from the second container and sautee.</li>
                <li>Add the fajita seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder.</li>
                <li>Add the rinsed brown rice.</li>
                <li>Add 1 quart of water.</li>
                <li>Boil for approximately 30 minutes on low.</li>
                <li>Monitor the water level and add water as needed until the rice is soft all the way through.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and add salt to taste.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Tofu Cooking Steps:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain the tofu and cut into 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
                <li>Add the tofu to a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add in the pork rub seasoning, smoked paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder and toss.</li>
                <li>Cover with the vegetable oil and toss.</li>
                <li>Spread them out on parchment paper on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for approximately 30 minutes such that they dry out slightly, toughen up slightly, and start to brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and add into the beans when the beans are done.</li>
            </ol>
