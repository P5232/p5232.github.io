        <h2>Vegan Chocolate Cake Recipe</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">(This recipe is based on and modified from Nora Cooks website.)</p>
        <b>Cake Ingredients:</b>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil OR melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <p></p>
        <b>Chocolate Frosting:</b>
        <li>1 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups vegan butter, softened baking sticks preferred</li>
        <li>2-3 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <p></p>
        <b>Cake Baking Steps:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease two 9-inch cake pans. Line the bottoms with cut parchment rounds and lightly flour for removal.</li>
            <li>Measure 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and add the tablespoon of vinegar to it. Stir and set aside to curdle.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the oil, applesauce, vanilla and almond milk/vinegar mixture. Mix on medium speed with a hand mixer until well combined.</li>
            <li>Lower the speed and slowly pour in the boiling water, continuing to mix until combined. The batter will seem very runny at this point; this is expected</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between your cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Wait until cool to remove from pans.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <b>Frosting Steps:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the cocoa powder to a large bowl. Whisk well to remove any clumps.</li>
            <li>Add the softened vegan butter and mix with a hand mixer until creamy and well combined.
            <li>Add half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk, and mix until combined. Add the rest of the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Mix starting on low and turn to high. Mix until fluffy and combined.</li>
            <li>If the frosting seems too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon or two at a time. If the frosting seems too wet and doesn't hold its shape, add more powdered sugar until it thickens up.</li>
            <li>Frost the cake.</li>
        </ol>
