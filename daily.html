        <h2>Daily Thoughts</h2>
        <p>10/26/2024: Sittng on the front porch on a windy fall day creating the html and css for this site.</p>
        <p>10/25/2024: Logic and science make us good at finding things that are wrong, but not figuring out how to make things better or looking to the future on what to build.</p>
        <p>10/24/2024: I really like the numbers in this date, and I felt uneasy about 10/7/2024. Not sure why. Is there something unsettling about odd numbers in the date? Today starts Simchat Torah…thinking about reading with the yearly schedule.</p>
        <p>10/23/2024: Add “cooked.wiki/” in front of a cooking website to get through the BS and just to the important stuff. I had difficult thoughts about dying right before bed last night. I think it affected my mood the rest of the day. Not sure what to do about that.</p>
        <p>10/22/2024: Started setting up a small vibe tester at worked and am looking forward to testing. Nice new challenge and learning experience.</p>
