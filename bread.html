            <h2>White Bread Recipe</h2>
            <b>Ingredients:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>3 cups King Arthur White Flour</li>
              <li>1/4 teaspoon of yeast</li>
              <li>1 heaping teaspoon of salt</li>
              <li>1.5 cups of water</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <b>Baking Steps:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine ingredients in a large bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until fully mixed. It should look too wet to handle, but dry enough to not pour; like sticky dough.</li>
                <li>Place a dish towel over the top of the bowl and let rise for 8-12 hours.</li>
                <li>Lightly flour the dough and counter. Rubber spatula out the dough onto the flour and roll it around in flour until it doesn't stick to the counter.</li>
                <li>Fold in the perimeter toward the underside to stretch the top of the dough. Transfer to a parchment-lined pressure-cooker 7-inch steel pot with glass lid.</li>
                <li>Let it rise some more for 30 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F so the oven is ready after the 2nd rise.</li>
                <li>Score the top of the bread with an X-shape. Spray the top with water and sprinkle on any desired toppings like seasame seed.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on.</li>
                <li>Bake for another 15-20 minutes with the lid off until the top starts to get brown and crusty.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and the pot and place on a wire rack to cool.</li>
            </ol>
